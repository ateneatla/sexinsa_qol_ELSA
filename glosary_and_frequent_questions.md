**What is a factor?**

A factor is a latent variable which describes the association among the number of observed variables. 
The maximum number of factors are equal to a number of observed variables. Every factor explains a certain variance in observed variables. 
The factors with the lowest amount of variance were dropped. Factors are also known as latent variables or hidden variables or unobserved 
variables or Hypothetical variables.

**What are the factor loadings?**

The factor loading is a matrix which shows the relationship of each variable to the underlying factor. 
It shows the correlation coefficient for observed variable and factor. It shows the variance explained by the observed variables.

**What is Eigenvalues?**

Eigenvalues represent variance explained each factor from the total variance. It is also known as characteristic roots.

**What are Communalities?**

Commonalities are the sum of the squared loadings for each variable. It represents the common variance. It ranges from 0-1
and value close to 1 represents more variance.

**What is Factor Rotation?**

Rotation is a tool for better interpretation of factor analysis. Rotation can be orthogonal or oblique. It re-distributed the commonalities
with a clear pattern of loadings.
